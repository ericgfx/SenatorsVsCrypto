# SenatorsVsCrypto
This repository is a way for the Crypto Community to effectively converse with the elected officials of the United States. My goal is simply to allow US citizens to participate in the emerging ecosystems we see in the cryptocurrency fields. Yes I understand there is a need for some regulation, but I feel the current approach is well, a bit lacking.

Starting with what to say to your Senator without sounding like a complete degen.

I'd also like to setup a quick spreadsheet so that residents can see where their Senators and Reps have voted for or against bills and laws.

Finally I'm a bit new to politics and new to GitHub, so please use your powers and knowledge for good. 

Cheers.
