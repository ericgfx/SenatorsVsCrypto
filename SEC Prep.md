# In Prep for SEC debate Sept 14th

### Dear Senator xxxxxxxx,
Please hold the SEC accountable to take action as regards the tech/crypto industry. As most recently highlighted in Sept 12th Forbes Article, the SECâ€™s (10 year+) lack of clarity, and the simultaneous threat of non-compliance, at the very least stifles innovation. And without a clear message, others have painted the space as a hostile and fearful environment.
As you know tech moves fast, fintech even faster. The window for us to establish projects and companies at the forefront of this brave new, and yes often disruptive, world is closing. Well-paying jobs, world-changing projects and an enormous amount of capital are abandoning the United States of America. 
End the ambiguity. 
Set a deadline for a simple quick test to say which projects are deemed either a security, a currency, or commodity, then direct them accordingly to either the SEC, the OCC, or CFTC for further guidelines. For the strength of our economy, we need this. We need this now. As my Senator I need to know you can act on this.
Thank you for your time Mr/Mrs xxxxxxxx
